 * HackerLand National Bank has a simple policy for warning clients about possible fraudulent account activity. 
 * If the amount spent by a client on a particular day is greater than or equal to 2X the client's median spending for a trailing number of days,
 * they send the client a notification about potential fraud. The bank doesn't send the client any notifications 
 * until they have at least that trailing number of prior days' transaction data.
 * Given the number of trailing days  and a client's total daily expenditures for a period of n days,
 * find and print the number of times the client will receive a notification over all n days.
